in our project we find the shortest distance and path betweeen two nodes in graph.
also, we calculate the diameter and the radius of the graph.
we examine if the graph satisfies the conditions of the-triangle-inequality
we create two classes: 
1. Graph_algo (sub classes : *Vertex *Edge) 
2. Graph

class Graph_algo: 
*gets array of vertexes and calculates the shortest distance between one place to another 
*calculates the path between two nodes(places) 
*calculates the path between two nodes with limitation - "black list" *calculates the diameter and the radius of the graph.

class Graph:
*gests two strings(path of files) that represent the initation of the graph *the second string is the tests. 
*the inpute of this class it's a file named out, the result of the tests.
